# User App

This is a simple User API built with TypeScript, Express and a simple in memory-db. The application provides basic CRUD operations for managing users.
Although the application is simple, it contains some bugs and the existing test suite is failing.

## Goals

To achieve the desired behavior, you will need to:
1. Identify and explain any bugs in the application code that might require changes.
2. Add/Update the test cases to correctly validate all of the application's behavior.

Keep in mind general coding best practices.
Make sure to highlight your thought process and way of working.

## Desired features of the application


- **Get Users**: Retrieve a list of all users.
- **Search Users**: Retrieve a list of users filtered by age or name.
- **Get User**: Retrieve one user.
- **Add User**: Add a new user with a name and age. Returns new user.
- **Update User**: Update an existing user's details. Returns updated user.
- **Delete User**: Remove a user by their ID.
